      "example_output": "## 🪞 Reflection Mirror\n\nWhat I'm hearing is someone at a crossroads. You've built something successful - a stable career, financial security, external markers of achievement. But there's a gap between where you are and where you feel you should be.\n\nYou used the word \"stuck\" three times. You mentioned your dream but immediately followed it with reasons why it's impractical. There's a part of you that's already decided it's not possible, and another part that won't let the dream die.\n\nThat tension? That's not a problem. That's information.\n\n## 🔍 Powerful Questions\n\nSit with these. Don't rush to answer:\n\n1. **If you knew you couldn't fail, what would you do tomorrow morning?**\n\n2. **What are you pretending not to know?** (You often already know the answer.)\n\n3. **In the story you tell yourself about why you can't change, who is the villain?** Is it money? Time? Other people's expectations? Is that villain real, or a convenient excuse?\n\n4. **What would 80-year-old you say about this decision?** Would they regret the risk you took, or the risk you didn't?\n\n5. **If your best friend described your situation to you, what advice would you give them?** Why aren't you taking that advice?\n\n## 🎯 Pattern Recognition\n\nI notice three patterns:\n\n**1. Permission-seeking:** You're waiting for someone to tell you it's okay. Your parents, your partner, society. But no one can give you permission to live your life. That permission has to come from you.\n\n**2. All-or-nothing thinking:** You see two options: stay miserable in safety, or risk everything for uncertainty. But there's a third path - strategic experimentation. Small bets, not big leaps.\n\n**3. Future-tripping:** You're so focused on the destination that you're paralyzed about the first step. The path reveals itself as you walk it, not before.\n\n## 💡 Reframes\n\n**Reframe 1: \"I'm stuck\" → \"I'm in a transition\"**\nStuck implies no movement. But you're clearly moving - you're questioning, seeking, growing. Transitions feel uncomfortable because you're between identities. That's not stuck; that's metamorphosis.\n\n**Reframe 2: \"It's too risky\" → \"Staying the same is the biggest risk\"**\nYou're calculating the risk of change but ignoring the risk of stagnation. What's the cost of another 5 years of \"fine\"? Of quiet desperation? Of wondering \"what if\"?\n\n**Reframe 3: \"I don't know what I want\" → \"I'm afraid to admit what I want\"**\nYou mentioned your dream in the first 30 seconds. You know. The question isn't what you want - it's whether you'll give yourself permission to want it.\n\n## 🧭 Values Clarification\n\nBased on what you've shared, your core values appear to be:\n\n1. **Freedom** - You crave autonomy over your time and decisions\n2. **Growth** - Stagnation feels like death to you\n3. **Impact** - You want your work to matter beyond a paycheck\n4. **Security** - But not at the cost of your soul\n5. **Authenticity** - The gap between who you are and who you're being is causing pain\n\nThe conflict: Security and Freedom are in tension. Your task is to find a path that honors both.\n\n## 🚀 Micro-Actions (This Week)\n\n**1. The 5 AM Experiment (Tuesday)**\nWake up one hour early. Spend that hour on your dream - not planning, DOING. Write, create, build. See how it feels to prioritize yourself first.\n\n**2. The Coffee Conversation (Thursday)**\nReach out to ONE person living the life you want. Not to ask for a job - just to learn. \"I admire your path. Could I buy you coffee and hear your story?\"\n\n**3. The Worst-Case Letter (Sunday)**\nWrite out your absolute worst-case scenario in detail. Then write how you'd recover from it. You'll likely realize you'd survive - and that realization is freedom.\n\n## 📚 Resources\n\n**Books:**\n- \"The Pathless Path\" by Paul Millerd (for career transitions)\n- \"Designing Your Life\" by Bill Burnett (for practical exercises)\n- \"The War of Art\" by Steven Pressfield (for overcoming resistance)\n\n**Framework:**\nTry the \"100 Days\" approach: Commit to working on your dream for 1 hour daily for 100 days. No pressure to succeed - just show up. At day 100, reassess.\n\n**Practice:**\nMorning Pages - 3 pages of stream-of-consciousness writing every morning. It clears the mental clutter and surfaces what you really think.\n\n## 💬 Closing Thought\n\n> \"The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.\" - Joseph Campbell\n\nYou already know what you need to do. The question is whether you'll trust yourself enough to do it.\n\nThe discomfort you feel isn't a sign that something is wrong. It's a sign that you're ready for more. Honor that.\n\nYour next chapter is waiting. It won't write itself."

Not 20 minutes. TWO minutes.\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Removes the \"I don't have time\" excuse\n- Builds the identity of \"someone who works out\"\n- Motion creates emotion - you'll often do more\n- Success builds momentum\n\n**The 2-Minute Workout:**\n- 10 jumping jacks\n- 10 squats\n- 10 push-ups (or wall push-ups)\n- Done. Victory.\n\n## 🏗️ Environment Design\n\n**Make it OBVIOUS:**\n- [ ] Lay out workout clothes on chair night before\n- [ ] Put yoga mat in middle of living room (visible)\n- [ ] Set phone wallpaper to workout motivation\n- [ ] Put \"WORKOUT\" sticky note on bathroom mirror\n\n**Make it EASY:**\n- [ ] Sleep in workout clothes (extreme but effective)\n- [ ] Have workout video queued on TV\n- [ ] Keep water bottle by bed\n- [ ] Remove all friction (no searching for clothes, equipment ready)\n\n**Make it ATTRACTIVE:**\n- [ ] Create energizing playlist\n- [ ] Only listen to favorite podcast DURING workout\n- [ ] Workout in front of window with natural light\n\n**Make it SATISFYING:**\n- [ ] Habit tracker on fridge (visual streak)\n- [ ] Post-workout smoothie ritual\n- [ ] Share progress with accountability partner\n\n## 🚧 Obstacle Pre-Planning\n\n| If... | Then... |\n|-------|--------|\n| I wake up tired | I'll do the 2-minute version only |\n| I have an early meeting | I'll do a 10-minute lunch workout |\n| I'm traveling | I'll do bodyweight exercises in hotel room |\n| I'm sick | I'll do gentle stretching or rest guilt-free |\n| I miss a day | I'll never miss twice in a row |\n| I feel unmotivated | I'll just put on workout clothes and decide after |\n| It's cold/dark | I'll have a space heater ready, lights on timer |\n\n## 📈 Progression Plan\n\n**Phase 1: Identity (Weeks 1-2)**\n- Goal: Show up daily, even for 2 minutes\n- Focus: Building the habit, not the fitness\n- Success = putting on clothes and moving\n\n**Phase 2: Consistency (Weeks 3-4)**\n- Goal: 10-minute workouts, 5x per week\n- Focus: Making it automatic\n- Add: Simple bodyweight routine\n\n**Phase 3: Intensity (Month 2)**\n- Goal: 20-minute workouts\n- Focus: Progressive overload\n- Add: Resistance bands or dumbbells\n\n**Phase 4: Optimization (Month 3+)**\n- Goal: Structured program\n- Focus: Specific fitness goals\n- Add: Tracking weights/reps, periodization\n\n## 🏆 Reward System\n\n**Immediate Rewards (Daily):**\n- ✅ Check off habit tracker (dopamine hit)\n- ☕ Enjoy protein smoothie\n- 🚿 Hot shower feels earned\n- 📱 5 minutes of guilt-free social media\n\n**Milestone Rewards:**\n- 7 days streak: New workout playlist\n- 30 days streak: New workout gear\n- 90 days streak: Massage or spa day\n- 180 days streak: Fitness equipment upgrade\n\n## 📊 Tracking Method\n\n**Simple Option:** Paper calendar on fridge, X each day\n**App Option:** Streaks app or Habitica\n**Advanced:** Notion template with notes on energy/mood\n\n**Track:**\n- Did I do it? (Yes/No)\n- Duration (minutes)\n- Energy level after (1-10)\n- Notes (optional)\n\n## 🆘 Recovery Protocol (When You Miss)\n\n**The Never-Miss-Twice Rule:**\nMissing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.\n\n**If you miss one day:**\n1. Don't beat yourself up (guilt doesn't help)\n2. Ask: \"What got in the way?\"\n3. Do the 2-minute version the next day NO MATTER WHAT\n4. Adjust your obstacle plan if needed\n\n**If you miss multiple days:**\n1. Restart with the tiny version (2 minutes)\n2. Reduce frequency temporarily (3x/week)\n3. Recommit to just 7 days\n4. Identify the real obstacle and solve it\n\n**Mantra:** \"Never zero. Something is always better than nothing.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Your Week 1 Action Plan\n\n**Tonight:**\n- [ ] Lay out workout clothes\n- [ ] Set alarm for 6:25 AM\n- [ ] Put habit tracker on fridge\n- [ ] Queue up 2-minute workout video\n\n**Tomorrow:**\n- [ ] Wake up, drink water\n- [ ] Put on clothes\n- [ ] Do 2 minutes of movement\n- [ ] Celebrate (seriously, fist pump)\n- [ ] Mark the X\n\n**This week:**\n- [ ] Do this 5 times\n- [ ] Don't increase duration yet\n- [ ] Focus on the streak, not the workout\n\nYou've got this. The goal isn't to get fit this week. The goal is to become someone who works out. The fitness will follow."
