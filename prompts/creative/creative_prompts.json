      "example_output": "## 📖 THE MEMORY THIEF\n*\"Some memories are worth dying for. Others are worth killing for.\"*\n\n---\n\n### 🎭 Characters\n\n**Protagonist: Dr. Elena Vance, 34**\nA neuroscientist who invented technology to extract and store human memories. Brilliant but emotionally distant after her sister's unsolved murder 10 years ago.\n\n- **Want:** Find her sister's killer using her memory extraction technology\n- **Need:** Learn to trust others and process her own grief\n- **Flaw:** Obsessive control; believes she can solve everything alone\n- **Arc:** From isolated genius → vulnerable human who accepts help and uncertainty\n\n**Antagonist: Marcus Webb, 52**\nElena's mentor and the university's dean of research. Charming, paternal, respected. Secretly built his career on stolen research—including Elena's sister's work. Killed her to protect his legacy.\n\n- **Motivation:** Protect his reputation and life's work at any cost\n- **Why Compelling:** Genuinely believes he deserves credit; sees himself as the hero of his own story. Has moments of real affection for Elena, making his betrayal devastating.\n\n**Supporting Characters:**\n\n*Detective James Okafor, 41*\nThe detective who worked Elena's sister's case. Haunted by his failure to solve it. Becomes Elena's reluctant partner and moral compass. Represents the human element she's missing.\n\n*Dr. Yuki Tanaka, 29*\nElena's lab assistant. Idealistic, sees the good in everyone. Provides warmth and comic relief. Her kidnapping in Act 2 forces Elena to care about someone other than her mission.\n\n*The Memory Keeper (unnamed until Act 3)*\nMysterious figure buying extracted memories on the black market. Red herring antagonist. Revealed to be Elena's sister—alive, but with no memory of her past life.\n\n---\n\n### 📍 Setting\n\n**Boston, 2031**\n\nA world where memory extraction is legal but heavily regulated. \"Memory parlors\" exist in gray areas—places where people sell traumatic memories to forget, or buy happy ones to feel. The technology has created a black market for memories of the wealthy and powerful.\n\nElena's lab is in a converted church—gothic architecture meets sterile technology. Stained glass windows cast colored light on humming servers that store thousands of human memories.\n\nThe city itself is divided: gleaming biotech towers downtown, crumbling neighborhoods where memory addicts wander, reliving purchased experiences on loop.\n\n---\n\n### 📊 Three-Act Structure\n\n**ACT 1: SETUP (Chapters 1-7)**\n\n*Opening Hook:*\nElena extracts a memory from a dying man—his final moments reveal a woman's face. It's her sister, alive, three years after her \"murder.\"\n\n*Inciting Incident:*\nElena discovers her sister's \"body\" was misidentified. Someone staged her death. The memory extraction reveals her sister witnessed something she wasn't supposed to see.\n\n*First Plot Point:*\nElena finds a hidden file in her sister's old research—evidence that someone at the university stole her work. The file is encrypted with a memory-key: only someone who experienced a specific moment can unlock it.\n\n**ACT 2: CONFRONTATION (Chapters 8-20)**\n\n*Rising Action:*\nElena and Detective Okafor follow the trail of stolen memories. Each extracted memory reveals another piece of the conspiracy. Someone is erasing witnesses—literally removing their memories of the crime.\n\n*Midpoint Twist:*\nElena extracts a memory from an amnesiac patient and sees her own face—she was there the night her sister \"died.\" Her own memories have been altered. She can't trust her own mind.\n\n*Dark Moment:*\nYuki is kidnapped. Marcus reveals himself, offering a trade: Yuki's life for Elena's silence and her memory extraction technology. Elena realizes Marcus has been manipulating her for years—he killed her sister and has been using Elena to perfect the technology that covers his tracks.\n\n**ACT 3: RESOLUTION (Chapters 21-28)**\n\n*Climax:*\nElena allows Marcus to extract her memories of the evidence—but she's planted a trap. The extraction process broadcasts to every screen in the city, revealing Marcus's crimes to the world. In the chaos, Elena confronts her sister (The Memory Keeper), who chose to forget her trauma rather than live with it.\n\n*Resolution:*\nMarcus is arrested. Elena's sister must decide whether to restore her memories and remember the trauma, or remain a stranger to her own life. Elena, finally, lets her sister make her own choice.\n\n*Final Image:*\nElena sits in the memory parlor, holding a vial containing her happiest memory of her sister. She could relive it forever. Instead, she puts it back on the shelf. \"Some memories,\" she says, \"are meant to fade.\"\n\n---\n\n### 🔄 Plot Twists\n\n1. **Elena's memories are altered** (Midpoint) - She was present at her sister's \"death\" but has no memory of it. The person she's hunting modified her own mind.\n\n2. **The sister is alive** (Act 2) - She didn't die; she chose to erase herself. She's been living as someone else, running the black market memory trade to fund her hiding.\n\n3. **Marcus is the killer** (Act 2 end) - Elena's beloved mentor, the man who supported her through grief, is the one who caused it. He's been using her research to cover his tracks for a decade.\n\n---\n\n### 💎 Key Scenes to Write\n\n1. **The Extraction** (Chapter 1) - Elena extracts the dying man's memory. Visceral, unsettling, establishes the technology and hooks the reader with the sister reveal.\n\n2. **The Memory Parlor** (Chapter 5) - Elena goes undercover in a black market memory den. Worldbuilding scene that shows the dark side of her invention.\n\n3. **Elena Watches Her Own Memory** (Chapter 14) - She sees herself at the crime scene, doing things she doesn't remember. Her reality fractures. Psychological horror.\n\n4. **The Confrontation with Marcus** (Chapter 22) - Mentor vs. protégé. He justifies everything. She realizes she loved him like a father. Emotional devastation.\n\n5. **Sisters Reunited** (Chapter 26) - Elena meets her sister, who doesn't recognize her. The sister she's been searching for doesn't exist anymore. Bittersweet, complex.\n\n---\n\n### 🎬 Opening Paragraph\n\n> The dying man's memories tasted like copper and regret.\n>\n> Dr. Elena Vance pressed the extraction node against his temple, watching the neural patterns cascade across her screen like a dying star. Twelve years of perfecting this technology, and she still couldn't get used to the intimacy of it—the way someone's entire life could unspool in streams of data, every joy and shame laid bare.\n>\n> \"Almost there,\" she murmured, though he couldn't hear her anymore. His eyes had gone glassy three minutes ago, fixed on something she couldn't see.\n>\n> The final memory surfaced like a bubble from deep water. A woman's face. Familiar. Impossible.\n>\n> Elena's hand trembled. She knew that face. She'd seen it every night for ten years, in dreams that felt more like hauntings.\n>\n> Her sister. Alive. Three years after they'd buried her."

That's my actual inbox. Years of newsletters I never read, receipts I never needed, and reply-all chains that should be illegal.\n\n**[VISUAL: Quick cuts of scrolling through endless emails]**\n\nI tried inbox zero. I tried folders. I tried just... ignoring it. Nothing worked.\n\n**[VISUAL: Cut to face, slight smile]**\n\nSo I let an AI delete them. ALL of them. And what happened next genuinely surprised me.\n\n**[VISUAL: Text on screen: \"47,283 → ???\"]**\n\nStay till the end, because the number it left me with? Not what I expected.\"\n\n---\n\n### INTRO (0:30-1:15) 📺\n\n**[VISUAL: Channel logo animation, upbeat music]**\n\n\"What's up everyone, I'm [Name], and on this channel we test productivity tools so you don't waste your time on ones that don't work.\n\n**[VISUAL: B-roll of previous videos]**\n\nIf you're new here, I've tested over 200 apps, and I only recommend the ones that actually changed how I work.\n\n**[VISUAL: Back to face]**\n\nToday, we're tackling the thing EVERYONE struggles with but nobody talks about: email overwhelm.\n\n**[VISUAL: Stats on screen]**\n\nThe average person spends 28% of their workday on email. That's 2.6 hours. Every. Single. Day.\n\n**[VISUAL: Calculator animation]**\n\nOver a career? That's FOUR YEARS of your life in your inbox.\n\n**[VISUAL: Face, direct to camera]**\n\nI'm about to show you how AI can give some of that time back. Let's get into it.\"\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 1: The Problem (1:15-3:00) 📧\n\n**[VISUAL: Screen share of cluttered inbox]**\n\n\"Okay, let's look at the disaster zone.\n\n**[VISUAL: Scrolling through inbox categories]**\n\nI've got:\n- 12,000 promotional emails I never opened\n- 8,000 social notifications from platforms I don't use anymore\n- 15,000 newsletters I subscribed to with good intentions\n- And about 10,000 random receipts, confirmations, and 'thanks!' replies\n\n**[VISUAL: Face, slightly embarrassed]**\n\nLook, I'm not proud of this.

That's almost two full work weeks.\n\n**[VISUAL: Face, determined]**\n\nSo I found another way.\"\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 2: The Solution (3:00-6:30) 🤖\n\n**[VISUAL: Tool interface reveal]**\n\n\"Enter [Tool Name].

You connect your Gmail or Outlook, and it starts analyzing.\n\n**[VISUAL: AI scanning animation]**\n\nWhat it's doing is looking at patterns:\n- Emails you never open? Probably safe to delete.\n- Senders you always ignore? Unsubscribe.\n- Old emails with no replies?

All of them things I could actually respond to.\n\n**[VISUAL: Face, genuine]**\n\nI didn't realize how much mental weight I was carrying from that number. Forty-seven thousand felt like forty-seven thousand tiny tasks I was failing at.\n\n**[VISUAL: Productivity stats if available]**\n\nThat week, I responded to emails faster. I missed fewer important messages. I actually hit inbox zero—REAL inbox zero—for the first time ever.\n\n**[VISUAL: Face, direct to camera]**\n\nThis isn't sponsored, by the way.
