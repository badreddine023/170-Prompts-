It provides:\n- Enough time to make real progress (not just nights/weekends)\n- Financial cushion to make good decisions\n- Lower stress = better creativity\n- Easy to adjust based on results\n\n**If employer says no:** Move to Option B for 3 months to validate, then Option A.\n\n### 🚀 Next Steps (This Week)\n1.

Thursday: Prepare negotiation talking points\n5. Friday: Have the conversation"
