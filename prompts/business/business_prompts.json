[Pause for laughs]\n>\n> This isn't just annoying—it's expensive. The average family wastes $1,500 a year on food that goes bad because they didn't plan. They spend 5 hours a week on meal decisions. And when planning fails, they default to takeout—4.5 times per week.\n>\n> This is a $50 billion problem hiding in plain sight.\"\n\n---\n\n### Slide 3: Solution\n\n**Headline:** MealGenius: Your AI Family Meal Planner\n\n**Content:**\n- 🤖 **AI That Learns:** Adapts to your family's tastes, allergies, and schedule\n- 📱 **30-Second Plans:** Complete weekly meal plan generated instantly\n- 🛒 **Auto Grocery Lists:** Synced to Instacart, Walmart, Amazon Fresh\n- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family-Friendly:** Kid-approved recipes that adults actually enjoy\n\n**Visual:** App screenshots showing the flow\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n> \"MealGenius is the AI meal planner that actually understands your family.\n>\n> Tell it your preferences once—Sarah's peanut allergy, Dad's keto diet, the kids' hatred of broccoli—and it remembers forever.\n>\n> Every Sunday, you get a personalized weekly plan in 30 seconds.

Premium at $9.99 gets unlimited plans, grocery integration, and nutrition tracking.\n>\n> But here's what makes this interesting: Every time a user orders groceries through our Instacart integration, we earn 3-5% of the basket. Average family grocery bill is $200/week. That's $8-10/month in passive revenue per active user—on top of their subscription.\n>\n> Our unit economics are strong: $18 to acquire a customer, $156 lifetime value.

Yummly is recipe discovery, not planning. Paprika is for cooking enthusiasts who want to organize recipes.\n>\n> None of them handle: 'My 8-year-old is picky, my husband is doing keto, and my daughter has a nut allergy.'\n>\n> That's our moat. Family meal planning is a different problem than individual meal planning. We're purpose-built for it.\"\n\n---\n\n### Slide 9: Team\n\n**Headline:** Built by Parents, for Parents\n\n**Content:**\n\n**Jane Smith - CEO**\n- Former Product Lead, Blue Apron\n- Scaled meal kit subscriptions 0 → $50M ARR\n- Mom of 3 (built MealGenius for herself first)\n\n**Mike Chen - CTO**\n- Former ML Engineer, Netflix\n- Built recommendation systems serving 200M users\n- Dad of 2, hates meal planning\n\n**Sarah Johnson - Head of Growth**\n- Former Growth, Calm\n- Scaled consumer app 1M → 10M users\n- Registered Dietitian\n\n**Advisors:**\n- [Name], Former CEO of [Relevant Company]\n- [Name], Partner at [Top VC]\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n> \"We're not just building for families—we ARE families.\n>\n> I spent 5 years at Blue Apron scaling their subscription business to $50M ARR. I know meal planning, I know subscriptions, and I know the pain—I have 3 kids.\n>\n> Mike built Netflix's recommendation engine. The same AI that knows you'll love that obscure documentary? He's applying that to knowing your family will love Tuesday's chicken recipe.\n>\n> Sarah scaled Calm from 1 to 10 million users. She's also a registered dietitian, so our nutrition features aren't just accurate—they're clinically informed.\n>\n> We've lived this problem. Now we're solving it.\"\n\n---\n\n### Slide 10: Financials\n\n**Headline:** Path to $10M ARR in 24 Months\n\n**Content:**\n\n| Metric | 2024 (Actual) | 2025 (Projected) | 2026 (Projected) |\n|--------|---------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Users | 47K | 200K | 600K |\n| Paying Users | 8K | 40K | 140K |\n| MRR | $89K | $450K | $1.4M |\n| ARR | $1.1M | $5.4M | $16.8M |\n| Gross Margin | 82% | 84% | 86% |\n\n**Key Assumptions:**\n- 20% conversion free → paid\n- 5% monthly churn (improving)\n- $15 blended CAC (paid + organic)\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n> \"Here's our path to $10M ARR.\n>\n> We're at $1.1M ARR today. With this funding, we project $5.4M ARR by end of 2025 and $16.8M by 2026.\n>\n> These aren't hockey-stick fantasies. We're modeling 20% free-to-paid conversion—we're already at 17%. We're modeling 5% monthly churn—we're at 4.2%.\n>\n> The biggest unlock is paid acquisition. We've grown almost entirely organically. With capital, we can pour fuel on a fire that's already burning.\"\n\n---\n\n### Slide 11: The Ask\n\n**Headline:** Raising $2M Seed to Capture the Family Meal Market\n\n**Content:**\n\n**Raising:** $2,000,000 Seed Round\n\n**Use of Funds:**\n| Category | Allocation | Purpose |\n|----------|------------|--------|\n| Engineering | 40% ($800K) | AI improvements, Android app, integrations |\n| Growth | 35% ($700K) | Paid acquisition, content, partnerships |\n| Team | 15% ($300K) | Key hires (2 engineers, 1 marketer) |\n| Operations | 10% ($200K) | Infrastructure, legal, buffer |\n\n**Milestones This Funding Achieves:**\n- 200K users (4x current)\n- $450K MRR (5x current)\n- Android launch\n- 3 major grocery partnerships\n- Series A ready\n\n**Speaker Notes:**\n> \"We're raising $2 million to become the default meal planning app for American families.\n>\n> 40% goes to engineering—we need to ship Android, improve our AI, and build more grocery integrations.\n>\n> 35% goes to growth.

MealGenius adjusts tomorrow's breakfast plan and adds eggs to your auto-order. Your family's nutrition is tracked automatically. Your kids are eating healthier without anyone thinking about it.\n>\n> We're building the operating system for how families eat.\n>\n> The meal planning market is $50 billion and fragmented. The family segment is wide open. We have the team, the traction, and the technology to own it.\n>\n> We're raising $2 million to make 'What's for dinner?' a question of the past.\n>\n> I'd love to have you join us. Thank you.\"\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Appendix Slides\n\n**A1: Detailed Cohort Analysis**\n[Month-by-month retention curves]\n\n**A2: Customer Acquisition Breakdown**\n[Channel-by-channel CAC and conversion]\n\n**A3: Competitive Feature Deep-Dive**\n[Detailed feature comparison]\n\n**A4: Technical Architecture**\n[AI/ML stack overview]\n\n**A5: Customer Testimonials**\n[Video clips or quotes]\n\n**A6: Press & Recognition**\n[Media mentions, awards]\n\n**A7: Cap Table**\n[Current ownership structure]\n\n**A8: Use of Funds Detail**\n[Month-by-month budget]"
